## Notes

- Most responsibilities await Community Steward hire (near-term priority)
- Currently, Coach–Educators handle community engagement as part of their coaching role
- Video feedback (Charlie) and onboarding (Toni) provide engagement touchpoints

## Operating System Notes

**Group Calls:**
- All group coaching calls are hosted natively on Skool (no Zoom)
- All recordings must be posted in Skool under Call Recordings within 24 hours

**1:1 Recordings:**
- Fast-track 1:1 recordings are not posted to the community to avoid noise and decision fatigue

**Accountability System:**
- Leaderboards (7-day Top 10, 30-day) and weekly video submissions are the primary accountability mechanisms
