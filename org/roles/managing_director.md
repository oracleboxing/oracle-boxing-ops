# Managing Director (Founding Partner)

**Version:** 2.1
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-18
**Purpose:** Define how this role creates leverage, focus, and clarity so Oracle Boxing can scale predictably.

---

## Role Framing

The Managing Director role exists to deliberately design how people, money, and effort are allocated across the business so Oracle Boxing can scale predictably without chaos, burnout, or dilution of its craft.

This role does not exist to "sit above" execution or creative work. It exists to create clarity, alignment, and leverage so other roles—particularly Content Creation and Coaching—can operate at their highest level.

**What this role is:**
- A practical, execution-oriented leadership role focused on leverage and scaling
- Adjacent to, not above, the Content Creator / IP Founder (Oliver)
- Accountable for designing systems that multiply team output

**What this role is not:**
- A corporate CEO title or hierarchy play
- A replacement for domain expertise (content, coaching, operations)
- A role that centralises all decision-making

Both founding partners are essential. Neither supersedes the other. When staffed, the MD owns the system design; the Content Creator / IP Founder owns the IP and craft.

## Role Summary

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Current Holder** | WIP / Unassigned |
| **Primary Department** | Executive & Strategy |
| **Works Alongside** | Content Creator / IP Founder (Oliver) |
| **Enables** | All departments and roles |

**Note:** This role is defined and parked as WIP. When activated, it will be assigned explicitly.

---

## Core Purpose

To maximise leverage across people, resources, and focus so Oracle Boxing can intentionally scale from £15k/month toward £50k/month while maintaining clarity, culture, and quality.

---

## Primary Objectives

### Objective 1: Maximise Output Per Team Member

Design the conditions where every person creates maximum value.

- Design incentive and compensation structures that reward value created
- Ensure roles are clearly defined with unambiguous ownership
- Align pay with impact, not just effort or hours
- Remove friction that prevents people from doing their best work
- Review and adjust structures as the business evolves

### Objective 2: Identify and Exploit Highest-Leverage Growth Constraints

Focus resources on the constraints that actually limit growth.

- Analyse business performance data and historical trends
- Identify bottlenecks, weak points, and missed opportunities
- Decide where time, money, and attention should be concentrated each quarter
- Say no to low-leverage initiatives that dilute focus
- Propose targeted interventions with clear expected outcomes

### Objective 3: Increase Team Velocity Without Increasing Chaos

Scale coordination and execution without adding complexity.

- Improve decision follow-through (decisions → system changes → documented)
- Ensure meetings result in real outcomes, not just discussion
- Reduce confusion, duplication, and dropped actions
- Design handoffs that don't require founder involvement
- Build systems that work without founder involvement

---

## Responsibilities → Outcomes

| Responsibility | What This Looks Like | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Incentive & Compensation Design** | Designing pay structures (flat / unit / performance), reviewing and adjusting over time | Team is fairly rewarded for value created; incentives drive right behaviours |
| **Resource Allocation & Focus** | Quarterly budget allocation review, deciding where effort and spend should concentrate, deprioritising low-leverage work | Resources flow to highest-impact activities |
| **Leverage Analysis** | Reviewing performance data (content, offers, retention, conversion), identifying constraints, proposing interventions | Clear bottlenecks identified with actionable plans |
| **Hiring & Team Design** | Identifying when a role is needed, sourcing and selecting talent, overseeing onboarding, ensuring new hires remove bottlenecks | Right people in right seats; hires reduce complexity, not add it |
| **Meeting Design & Follow-Through** | Preparing agendas, framing decisions clearly, ensuring decisions become updated roles/processes/documentation | Decisions translate into real system changes |
| **Organisational Documentation Integrity** | Ensuring GitHub repo reflects reality, updating as business evolves, preventing drift | "How we work" matches "how it's documented" |

---

## What the Managing Director Does NOT Own

Clarity on boundaries prevents role regression and overload:

- **Content planning or filming** — Oliver's domain
- **Editing or publishing content** — Content team's domain
- **Day-to-day coaching delivery** — Coach–Educators own this
- **Default problem-solving for other roles** — Each role owns their domain
- **Tactical execution inside funnels** (once delegated) — Growth Operator executes
- **Micromanaging team output** — Operators are trusted to deliver

If this role is regularly doing these things, something is misaligned and needs correction.

---

## Decision Rights

### The Managing Director Owns Decisions On:

- **Org design:** departments, roles, interfaces, how work is structured
- **Hiring:** when, who, how roles are defined and filled
- **Incentives:** pay structures, bonus criteria, compensation philosophy
- **Priorities:** quarterly focus, what gets resourced, what gets cut
- **Budget allocation:** where money flows, what's worth spending on

### The Managing Director Does NOT Override:

- **IP decisions** — content philosophy, teaching approach, creative direction
- **Content strategy** — what to create, how to present it, brand voice

These remain owned by the Content Creator / IP Founder (Oliver).

This division reinforces co-founder parity: the MD designs the system, the Content Creator / IP Founder owns the craft.

---

## Key Deliverables & Cadence

| Deliverable | Cadence | Success Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Incentive & pay structure review | As needed / Quarterly | Clear alignment between impact and compensation |
| Quarterly budget allocation review | Quarterly | Budget focus documented and communicated |
| Leverage / constraint analysis | Quarterly | Clear bottleneck identified + plan proposed |
| Hiring decisions & onboarding | As needed | New hires reduce founder bottlenecks within 30 days |
| Meeting agendas & follow-through | Weekly / Bi-weekly | Decisions implemented, not forgotten |
| Org documentation updates | As needed | GitHub reflects reality |

---

## Key Interfaces

| Who | Purpose | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Content Creator (Oliver)** | Alignment on direction, priorities, capacity. Co-founder parity. | Weekly |
| **Growth Operator** | Focus, leverage, resourcing, campaign strategy | Weekly |
| **Operations Manager** | Reliability, delegation readiness, system health | Weekly |
| **Coach–Educators** | Clarity on roles, incentives, execution feedback | As needed |
| **Community & Retention** | Retention signals, member health, churn patterns | As needed |

---

## KPIs / Success Measures

These measure whether the role is creating leverage—not vanity metrics.

| Measure | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| **Reduction in founder bottlenecks** | Work flows without waiting on founders |
| **Improved clarity of roles and incentives** | Everyone knows what they own and how they're rewarded |
| **Faster execution after decisions** | Decisions translate to system changes within days, not weeks |
| **Ability to step back** | MD can be absent for a week without performance drop |
| **Measurable progress toward £50k/month** | Revenue growth attributable to focus and leverage improvements |
| **Team velocity without burnout** | Sustainable execution pace, no firefighting culture |

---

## Success-Only Compensation Model

This role is compensated only when defined outcomes are achieved. This model is designed to be board-defensible and attribution-safe.

See [Managing Director Compensation](../compensation/managing_director.md) for full details.

---

### Two-Layer Model

The Managing Director compensation has two distinct layers:

| Layer | Name | Purpose | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1 (Primary)** | Constraint Removal Bounties | Pay for directly attributable outcomes | Per-bounty payout when constraint is removed |
| **2 (Secondary)** | Run-Rate Milestone Bonuses | Reward sustained system-level results | One-time bonus when revenue threshold is held |

> Constraint bounties pay for directly attributable outcomes; run-rate milestones reward sustained system-level results without claiming credit for every pound of revenue.

---

### Definition: Monthly Run Rate

Run rate is **not**:
- "We hit a big month once"
- "We could do this again if everything goes right"
- A projection or forecast

**Definition:**
> Monthly run rate is defined as the average monthly gross revenue across the most recent 3 full calendar months.

**Worked Example:**
- October: £22,000
- November: £26,000
- December: £27,000
- **Run Rate = (£22,000 + £26,000 + £27,000) ÷ 3 = £25,000/month**

The run rate only updates after a calendar month fully closes.

---

### Definition: Growth Constraint

> A constraint is a specific, observable bottleneck that prevents the business from producing, converting, or retaining at the next level.

**Constraint Categories:**

| Category | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Capacity** | Production or delivery throughput limits | Content throughput, coaching session capacity, founder time bottleneck |
| **Conversion** | Friction in turning attention into revenue | Funnel efficiency, sales process friction, pricing/package confusion |
| **Coordination** | Decisions not translating into results | Unclear ownership, decisions not implemented, documentation drift |
| **Capital Allocation** | Resources not flowing to highest leverage | Spend scattered, wrong priorities funded, wrong hires made |

---

### Definition: Constraint Removed

A constraint is only considered "removed" if **all 3 conditions** are met:

| # | Condition | What It Means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Before/After is explicit** | Documented baseline vs. documented new state |
| 2 | **System change exists** | Process, ownership, or tooling changed—not "we tried harder" |
| 3 | **Benefit sustains without hero effort** | Result holds for defined period without extraordinary intervention |

**Critical:**
- Ideas, effort, meetings, or proposals are not payable outcomes.
- If it isn't documented, it didn't happen.
- Partial completion does not earn partial payout (unless explicitly defined in the bounty spec).

---

### Quarterly Pre-Agreement Process (Board Approval)

At the start of each quarter, the role holder proposes 1–3 constraints to the board. The board reviews and approves each bounty before work begins.

**No bounty is payable unless pre-approved. No retroactive bounties.**

For each proposed constraint, a written **Bounty Spec** must contain:

| # | Element | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Constraint Statement** | One sentence describing the bottleneck |
| 2 | **Evidence & Impact** | Data showing this limits growth (e.g., missed uploads, conversion rate baseline, churn data, support backlog) |
| 3 | **Baseline (Current State)** | Clear description of what is true today |
| 4 | **Removal Definition (Success Condition)** | Binary/verifiable condition including sustainability window (e.g., "holds for 6 consecutive weeks") |
| 5 | **Owner & Dependencies** | Who must do what; what the MD controls vs. influences; explicit dependencies |
| 6 | **System Change Required** | What will materially change (roles, process, tooling, documentation) |
| 7 | **Verification Plan** | How the board will verify success (metrics check + documentation review) |
| 8 | **Payout Amount** | The bounty value in pounds |
| 9 | **Non-goals / Exclusions** | What does not count as success (prevents scope creep) |
| 10 | **Approval Sign-off** | "Approved by Jordan + Oliver on YYYY-MM-DD" |

---

### Layer 1: Constraint Removal Bounties (Primary)

This is the primary pay mechanism for the Managing Director role.

**Structure:**
- Each quarter includes 1–3 pre-approved bounties
- Each bounty has an agreed payout amount
- If constraint is removed per the spec → payout is earned
- If constraint is not removed → £0 for that bounty

**Example Ranges** (illustrative, not commitments):
- Typical bounty: £1,000–£2,500 depending on leverage and difficulty
- Quarterly total target: £2,000–£6,000 (only if successful)

Exact amounts are defined per bounty in the pre-agreement process.

---

### Layer 2: Run-Rate Milestone Bonuses (Secondary)

These bonuses reward sustained scale. They do not require claiming credit for all revenue—they acknowledge that system improvements contributed to reaching a new operating level.

**Milestone Structure:**

| Run Rate Threshold | One-Time Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| £25,000/month | £2,000 |
| £35,000/month | £3,000 |
| £50,000/month | £5,000 |

**Trigger:**
> Milestone is triggered when the 3-month rolling average (run rate) meets or exceeds the threshold.

**Guardrails:**
- One-time per milestone (cannot be earned twice)
- Paid after the third month closes (when calculation is final)
- No clawback if revenue later falls below the threshold
- Milestones must be reached in order (cannot skip)

---

### Example Bounty Spec

This is a template example—not a current commitment.

---

**Q1 2025 Bounty Spec: Publishing & Performance Loop**

| Element | Content |
| --- | --- |
| **Constraint Statement** | Content Manager responsibilities lack clear ownership and systematic performance tracking, causing missed uploads and reactive founder involvement |
| **Evidence & Impact** | 2 missed uploads in past 8 weeks; no weekly insights report; Jordan involved in 60% of publishing decisions |
| **Baseline** | Publishing schedule sometimes missed; performance data reviewed ad-hoc; no documented Content Manager workflow |
| **Removal Definition** | 0 missed uploads for 6 consecutive weeks AND weekly insights report delivered every week AND documented Content Manager role with clear ownership |
| **Owner & Dependencies** | MD owns system design and documentation; G executes Content Manager duties; Oliver provides raw footage on agreed schedule |
| **System Change** | Updated [content_manager.md](content_manager.md) with explicit checklist; weekly insights template created; publishing calendar implemented |
| **Verification Plan** | Board reviews: (1) upload log for 6-week period, (2) 6 weekly insights reports delivered, (3) role file updated in repo |
| **Payout Amount** | £1,500 |
| **Non-goals** | Does not include AVD% improvement (that's a Content Producer performance bonus); does not require new tooling purchase |
| **Approval Sign-off** | Approved by Jordan + Oliver on YYYY-MM-DD |

---

### Fairness & Dispute Prevention

To prevent ambiguity and resentment:

1. **Pre-agree definitions** — All success conditions must be defined before work begins
2. **Binary success** — Payout is only earned if the pre-agreed success condition is met (no partial credit unless explicitly defined in the bounty spec)
3. **External factors** — If external factors dominate the result, the board can revise future bounties; past agreed bounties stand as written
4. **Documentation requirement** — If it's not written down, it doesn't exist
5. **No retroactive bounties** — Cannot claim payment for past work not covered by a pre-approved spec
6. **Quarterly review** — Both founders review the model quarterly and can adjust future bounties by mutual agreement

---

## Notes

- This role is defined and parked as WIP. When activated, it will be assigned explicitly
- The co-founder relationship with Oliver is 50/50 in authority, with distinct domains
- This role scales Oracle Boxing by designing leverage, not by doing more
- Success is measured by what the team achieves, not by how busy the Managing Director is
