# Managing Director (Founding Partner)

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14
**Purpose:** Define how this role creates leverage, focus, and clarity so Oracle Boxing can scale predictably.

---

## Role Framing

The Managing Director role exists to deliberately design how people, money, and effort are allocated across the business so Oracle Boxing can scale predictably without chaos, burnout, or dilution of its craft.

This role does not exist to "sit above" execution or creative work. It exists to create clarity, alignment, and leverage so other roles—particularly Content Creation and Coaching—can operate at their highest level.

**What this role is:**
- A practical, execution-oriented leadership role focused on leverage and scaling
- Adjacent to, not above, the Content Creator / IP Founder (Oliver)
- Accountable for designing systems that multiply team output

**What this role is not:**
- A corporate CEO title or hierarchy play
- A replacement for domain expertise (content, coaching, operations)
- A role that centralises all decision-making

Both founding partners are essential. Neither supersedes the other. Jordan owns the system design; Oliver owns the IP and craft.

## Role Summary

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Current Holder** | Jordan |
| **Primary Department** | Executive & Strategy |
| **Works Alongside** | Content Creator / IP Founder (Oliver) |
| **Enables** | All departments and roles |

---

## Core Purpose

To maximise leverage across people, resources, and focus so Oracle Boxing can intentionally scale from £15k/month toward £50k/month while maintaining clarity, culture, and quality.

---

## Primary Objectives

### Objective 1: Maximise Output Per Team Member

Design the conditions where every person creates maximum value.

- Design incentive and compensation structures that reward value created
- Ensure roles are clearly defined with unambiguous ownership
- Align pay with impact, not just effort or hours
- Remove friction that prevents people from doing their best work
- Review and adjust structures as the business evolves

### Objective 2: Identify and Exploit Highest-Leverage Growth Constraints

Focus resources on the constraints that actually limit growth.

- Analyse business performance data and historical trends
- Identify bottlenecks, weak points, and missed opportunities
- Decide where time, money, and attention should be concentrated each quarter
- Say no to low-leverage initiatives that dilute focus
- Propose targeted interventions with clear expected outcomes

### Objective 3: Increase Team Velocity Without Increasing Chaos

Scale coordination and execution without adding complexity.

- Improve decision follow-through (decisions → system changes → documented)
- Ensure meetings result in real outcomes, not just discussion
- Reduce confusion, duplication, and dropped actions
- Design handoffs that don't require founder involvement
- Build systems that work when Jordan isn't watching

## Responsibilities → Outcomes

| Responsibility | What This Looks Like | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Incentive & Compensation Design** | Designing pay structures (flat / unit / performance), reviewing and adjusting over time | Team is fairly rewarded for value created; incentives drive right behaviours |
| **Resource Allocation & Focus** | Quarterly budget allocation review, deciding where effort and spend should concentrate, deprioritising low-leverage work | Resources flow to highest-impact activities |
| **Leverage Analysis** | Reviewing performance data (content, offers, retention, conversion), identifying constraints, proposing interventions | Clear bottlenecks identified with actionable plans |
| **Hiring & Team Design** | Identifying when a role is needed, sourcing and selecting talent, overseeing onboarding, ensuring new hires remove bottlenecks | Right people in right seats; hires reduce complexity, not add it |
| **Meeting Design & Follow-Through** | Preparing agendas, framing decisions clearly, ensuring decisions become updated roles/processes/documentation | Decisions translate into real system changes |
| **Organisational Documentation Integrity** | Ensuring GitHub repo reflects reality, updating as business evolves, preventing drift | "How we work" matches "how it's documented" |

## What the Managing Director Does NOT Own

Clarity on boundaries prevents role regression and overload:

- **Content planning or filming** — Oliver's domain
- **Editing or publishing content** — Content team's domain
- **Day-to-day coaching delivery** — Coach–Educators own this
- **Default problem-solving for other roles** — Each role owns their domain
- **Tactical execution inside funnels** (once delegated) — Growth Operator executes
- **Micromanaging team output** — Operators are trusted to deliver

If this role is regularly doing these things, something is misaligned and needs correction.

---

## Decision Rights

### The Managing Director Owns Decisions On:

- **Org design:** departments, roles, interfaces, how work is structured
- **Hiring:** when, who, how roles are defined and filled
- **Incentives:** pay structures, bonus criteria, compensation philosophy
- **Priorities:** quarterly focus, what gets resourced, what gets cut
- **Budget allocation:** where money flows, what's worth spending on

### The Managing Director Does NOT Override:

- **IP decisions** — content philosophy, teaching approach, creative direction
- **Content strategy** — what to create, how to present it, brand voice

These remain owned by the Content Creator / IP Founder (Oliver).

This division reinforces co-founder parity: Jordan designs the system, Oliver owns the craft.

## KPIs / Success Measures

These measure whether the role is creating leverage—not vanity metrics.

| Measure | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| **Reduction in founder bottlenecks** | Work flows without waiting on Jordan |
| **Improved clarity of roles and incentives** | Everyone knows what they own and how they're rewarded |
| **Faster execution after decisions** | Decisions translate to system changes within days, not weeks |
| **Ability to step back** | Jordan can be absent for a week without performance drop |
| **Measurable progress toward £50k/month** | Revenue growth attributable to focus and leverage improvements |
| **Team velocity without burnout** | Sustainable execution pace, no firefighting culture |

## Notes

- Jordan currently also holds Growth Operator and Operations Manager roles—these will be delegated as hiring progresses
- The co-founder relationship with Oliver is 50/50 in authority, with distinct domains
- This role scales Oracle Boxing by designing leverage, not by doing more
- Success is measured by what the team achieves, not by how busy the Managing Director is
