# Toni — Senior Coach, Closer, and Coach Trainer

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-17
**Purpose:** Define Toni's scope, decision rights, and compensation model for 1–1 coaching and coach-training.

---

## Role Summary

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Current Holder** | Toni |
| **Primary Department** | Product & Coaching |
| **Reports To** | Founders (Jordan + Oliver) |
| **Collaborates With** | Other coaches (e.g., Charlie), Growth/Operations |

---

## Role Framing

This role exists within a business model where **all clients originate from the brand, content, and founders**—not from Toni's personal acquisition efforts. Demand generation is owned by Oracle Boxing; Toni's value lies in **operational execution**.

Toni's "ownership" is defined as:

1. **Converting warm demand** — closing qualified leads into 1–1 coaching packages
2. **Delivering results** — executing high-quality coaching sessions
3. **Creating leverage** — training other coaches using Toni's documented methodology

Compensation is designed to reward what Toni directly controls:

- **Closing the deal** (conversion)
- **Delivery quality** (coaching sessions)
- **Leverage creation** (training other coaches using Toni's IP)

---

## Scope and Responsibilities

### A) Sales / Closing (Warm Upsell)

- [ ] Convert qualified/warm leads into 1–1 coaching packages
- [ ] Maintain professional sales conduct aligned with Oracle Boxing brand
- [ ] Properly log all sales activity and client handoffs
- [ ] Follow established pricing and packaging guidelines

### B) Coaching Delivery

- [ ] Deliver 1–1 coaching calls at agreed frequency per client package
- [ ] Maintain coaching quality standards aligned with Oracle Boxing methodology
- [ ] Ensure client experience is high and results-focused
- [ ] Track client progress and session completion

### C) IP + Coach Training (Leverage Layer)

- [ ] Maintain a coaching "blueprint" / methodology document
- [ ] Document methodology into a trainable format
- [ ] Train junior coaches (e.g., Charlie) to deliver coaching using the blueprint
- [ ] Make all training materials visible and subject to founder approval

---

## What This Role Does NOT Own

To prevent ambiguity, the following are explicitly **outside** this role's scope:

- **Marketing acquisition risk** — Toni does not own lead generation or demand creation
- **A separate coaching business** — This role operates within Oracle Boxing, not as an independent entity
- **Equity** — No equity is implied by this role document
- **Automatic revenue share on other coaches' income** — Training other coaches does not create ongoing entitlement to their earnings

---

## Compensation Model

Toni's compensation follows a **3-lane structure** that aligns pay with value created.

### Lane 1 — Coaching Delivery (Unit Rate)

| Component | Amount | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per 1–1 coaching call delivered | $30 | Monthly |

**Definitions:**

- A "call" = one scheduled 1–1 coaching session that is delivered
- **Delivered** means the session occurred as scheduled, or the client no-showed after proper reminder was sent
- If a session is rescheduled by mutual agreement, it is not counted until actually delivered
- Client-initiated cancellations with 24+ hours notice do not count as delivered

---

### Lane 2 — Sales Commission (Closing Bonus)

| Component | Rate | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Closing commission | 10% | Net Coaching Revenue |

**Net Coaching Revenue Definition:**

> **Net Coaching Revenue = Package Price − $297 community subscription fee**

The $297 community subscription is mandatory for all 1–1 clients and is **non-commissionable**.

**Package Tiers (3-month packages):**

| Package | Price | Frequency | Calls (~) | Net Coaching Revenue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard | $1,500 | 1×/week | 12 | $1,203 |
| Intensive | $2,000 | 2×/week | 24 | $1,703 |
| Elite | $2,500 | 3×/week | 36 | $2,203 |

**Commission Conditions:**

- Commission is calculated on **cash collected**, net of refunds within the agreed refund window
- If a client refunds within the refund window, commission is reversed or withheld
- A "closed deal" means: client has signed up, paid, and the refund window has passed

---

### Lane 3 — IP / Coach Training Bonus (Milestone-Based)

This lane rewards Toni for creating **leverage** through coach training, without creating ongoing revenue share entitlements.

**Training Bonus Structure:**

| Milestone | Amount | Conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coach training completion | $400 | One-time, per trained coach |

**Eligibility Criteria (all must be met):**

1. **Training completed** — Charlie (or other trainee) has completed training using Toni's documented blueprint
2. **First client closed** — The trained coach closes their first 1–1 coaching client
3. **Delivery verified** — The trained coach delivers the first two weeks of coaching with positive feedback

**"Positive feedback" defined as:**
- Founder approval based on client check-in, OR
- Simple client satisfaction confirmation (no complaints, client continuing)

**Documentation & Approval Requirement (Non-negotiable):**

Before training bonus eligibility begins, Toni must provide a written outline including:

- [ ] What is being taught (topics, skills, methodology)
- [ ] Session structure (format, duration, frequency)
- [ ] Standards and expectations for the trainee
- [ ] Common failure modes and how to avoid them
- [ ] How the trainee will be evaluated

Founders must approve the training outline before training begins.

**Ongoing Support:**

- After initial training is complete, ongoing mentoring does not create additional revenue share
- Ad-hoc support is handled as normal team collaboration (unpaid)
- Significant additional training scope must be separately scoped and pre-approved

## Worked Examples

### Per-Package Compensation Breakdown

| Package | Calls | Delivery Pay | Net Coaching Revenue | Closing Bonus (10%) | Toni Total | Business Keeps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1×/week ($1,500) | 12 | $420 | $1,203 | $120 | $540 | $663 |
| 2×/week ($2,000) | 24 | $840 | $1,703 | $170 | $1,010 | $693 |
| 3×/week ($2,500) | 36 | $1,260 | $2,203 | $220 | $1,480 | $723 |

**Calculation Notes:**

- Delivery Pay = $35 × number of calls
- Closing Bonus = 10% × Net Coaching Revenue (rounded to nearest $10)
- Business Keeps = Net Coaching Revenue − Toni Total

### Training Bonus Example

**Scenario:** Toni trains Charlie using an approved blueprint.

| Event | Payout |
| --- | --- |
| Training outline approved by founders | $0 (eligibility begins) |
| Charlie completes training | $0 (awaiting milestone) |
| Charlie closes first 1–1 client | $0 (awaiting delivery) |
| Charlie delivers 2 weeks with positive feedback | **$400** (bonus paid) |

## Progression and Review

### Review Cadence

- Compensation model reviewed **quarterly**
- Reviews aligned with standard business performance reviews

### Criteria for Increases

Compensation adjustments may be considered based on:

- Increased leadership or operational responsibilities
- Sustained high performance (conversion rates, client satisfaction)
- Significant changes to package mix or pricing
- Taking on additional training or mentorship scope

### Design Principles

This compensation model is designed to be:

- **Scalable** — Works whether Toni delivers 5 or 50 clients per month
- **Defensible** — Clear, documented logic for every payment
- **Aligned** — Pays for what Toni controls, not for what the business owns
