# Architect of Scale & Culture (Operating Founder)

**Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14
**Purpose:** Define how this role designs, aligns, and maintains the systems that allow Oracle Boxing to scale cleanly.

## Role Framing

This is not a traditional corporate CEO role.

The Architect of Scale & Culture exists to design the organisational system, align people and priorities, and remove friction so the team can execute at a high level without confusion or burnout.

This role is not focused on day-to-day execution, but on structure, direction, and leverage.

It operates adjacent to—not above—the Content Creator / IP Founder (Oliver). Both roles are essential; neither supersedes the other.

## Role Summary

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Current Holder** | Jordan |
| **Primary Department** | Executive & Strategy |
| **Works Alongside** | Content Creator / IP Founder (Oliver) |
| **Enables** | All departments and roles |

---

## Core Purpose

To design, align, and maintain the systems, roles, and culture that allow Oracle Boxing to scale cleanly while protecting its IP and standards.

---

## Responsibilities

### 1. Org & Team Architecture

Design the structure that lets people do their best work.

- Design departments, roles, and how they interface with each other
- Decide when to hire versus rebundle existing work
- Ensure no one holds incompatible or overloaded roles
- Maintain the organisational blueprint as the single source of truth
- Define clear ownership so nothing falls through the cracks

### 2. Strategy & Direction

Set the course and protect focus.

- Set quarterly priorities and communicate them clearly
- Decide what *not* to work on (just as important as what to pursue)
- Align content, growth, and product efforts toward the same outcomes
- Protect long-term IP and brand from short-term optimisation pressure
- Translate vision into executable focus areas

### 3. Growth Orchestration (Not Execution)

Enable growth systems without permanently owning them.

- Choose which growth levers matter most right now
- Review performance at the right altitude (not in the weeds)
- Translate vision into priorities the Growth Operator can execute
- Hire and enable a dedicated Growth Operator to own execution
- Hold the growth function accountable without micromanaging

**This role orchestrates growth systems but does not permanently own their execution.**

### 4. Culture & Standards

Shape how people work together.

- Set behavioural standards for ownership, clarity, and follow-through
- Reinforce a culture of calm execution over reactive firefighting
- Address resentment, confusion, or misalignment early—before it festers
- Model long-term thinking and precision in communication
- Protect the team from burnout by designing sustainable workloads

### 5. Friction Removal (The Lubricant Function)

Keep the machine running smoothly.

- Remove bottlenecks that slow execution
- Clarify ownership when it's ambiguous
- Simplify processes that have become unnecessarily complex
- Reduce emotional and operational drag between roles
- Spot where things are grinding and intervene before they break

This is the lubricant function: making sure the system doesn't seize up.

---

## What This Role Is Not Responsible For

Clarity on what stays outside this role:

- Editing or publishing content
- Day-to-day coaching delivery
- Default problem-solving for other roles (they own their domains)
- Owning every funnel detail or campaign execution
- Carrying operational tasks long-term (these get delegated)
- Making IP or content decisions (that's Oliver's domain)

If this role is doing these things regularly, something is misaligned.

---

## Decision Rights

### This Role Decides

- Org design: departments, roles, interfaces, reporting lines
- Hiring: when, who, and how roles are structured
- Priorities: quarterly focus, resource allocation, what gets cut
- Process: how the operating system works, cadence, accountability

### This Role Does Not Override

- IP and content decisions owned by the Content Creator (Oliver)
- Domain-specific execution owned by operators (Growth, Ops, Coaches)

### How Decisions Flow

This role sets direction and empowers operators to execute. It doesn't centralise decisions—it distributes them clearly.

---

## Key Interfaces

| Who | Purpose | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Content Creator (Oliver)** | Alignment on direction, cadence, and standards. Co-founder parity. | Weekly |
| **Growth Operator** | Priorities, metrics, resourcing, campaign strategy | Weekly |
| **Operations Manager** | Reliability, bottlenecks, delegation readiness | Weekly |
| **Coach–Educators** | Capacity, student outcomes, feedback loops | As needed |
| **Community & Retention** | Retention signals, member health, churn patterns | As needed |

---

## KPIs / Success Measures

These measure whether the role is working—not vanity metrics.

| Measure | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| **Role clarity across the team** | Everyone knows what they own and what they don't |
| **Reduction in founder bottlenecks** | Work flows without waiting on Jordan |
| **Execution velocity without burnout** | Team ships consistently and sustainably |
| **Hiring effectiveness** | Right people in right seats, onboarded cleanly |
| **Ability to step back** | Jordan can be absent for a week without performance loss |
| **Friction reduction** | Fewer misunderstandings, handoff failures, and ambiguity |

---

## Notes

- Jordan currently also holds Growth Operator and Operations Manager roles—these will be delegated as hiring progresses
- The co-founder relationship with Oliver is 50/50 in authority, with distinct domains
- This role scales Oracle Boxing by designing leverage, not by doing more
