## Key Responsibilities

### Group Coaching Sessions
- [ ] Punctually host assigned group coaching calls on Skool (no Zoom)
- [ ] Plan the coaching call at least 10 minutes in advance
- [ ] Deliver engaging, educational coaching content
- [ ] Publish the recording to Skool Call Recordings within 24 hours
- [ ] Align weekly on 3 shared core topics across all coaches/time zones

**Operating Notes:**
- All group coaching calls are hosted natively on Skool (no Zoom)
- All recordings must be posted in Skool under Call Recordings within 24 hours
- Only the most valuable calls will be curated into courses over time
- Each week, we plan 3 core coaching topics shared across all coaches/time zones. Calls still allow flexibility for individual needs

### 1-1 Coaching
- [ ] Deliver 45-minute 1-1 sessions to paid package customers
- [ ] Prepare personalised feedback for each session
- [ ] Track session completion and member progress

**Note:** 1-1 coaching is primarily reserved for paid coaching packages. Leaderboard 1-1 rewards are limited and defined by the weekly plan—not guaranteed for all top-10 members. Fast-track 1:1 recordings are not posted to the community to avoid noise and decision fatigue.

### Leaderboard Rewards System
- [ ] Maintain and update 7-Day Leaderboard (Top 10) and 30-Day Leaderboard
- [ ] Run weekly video submissions and accountability
- [ ] Distribute rewards as defined by the weekly plan

**Operating Notes:**
- We run a 7-Day Leaderboard (Top 10) and a 30-Day Leaderboard
- Rewards are structured to incentivise submissions and progress without overextending 1:1 coaching time

### Video Feedback (Charlie)
- [ ] Leave weekly video feedback on qualifying member posts
- [ ] Follow criteria: key takeaways, actionables, below 5 minutes
- [ ] Clear feedback queue weekly

### Community Engagement
- [ ] Maintain active presence in community (comments, likes, encouragement)
- [ ] Respond to member questions and posts
- [ ] Model positive community behaviour

### Onboarding (Toni)
- [ ] Deliver 15-minute onboarding call to every new member
- [ ] Set expectations and help members get started
- [ ] Answer initial questions and provide guidance
