## Next Hire to Remove Founder Bottleneck

**Operations Manager (dedicated)** – Allow Jordan to step back from:
- Daily support inbox management
- Routine automation monitoring
- Tax and compliance administration

This would free Jordan to focus on strategic priorities while a dedicated Ops Manager handles day-to-day reliability and support.
