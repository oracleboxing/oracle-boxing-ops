## Next Hire to Remove Founder Bottleneck

**Growth Operator (dedicated)** – Allow Jordan to step back from:
- Day-to-day funnel building and landing page creation
- Email sequence writing and newsletter management
- Ad campaign creation and monitoring

This would free Jordan to focus on strategy, offer design, and high-level campaign planning while a dedicated Growth Operator handles execution.
