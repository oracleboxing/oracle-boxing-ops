## Current State (Interim)

Until a Community Steward is hired:
- **Community presence** is handled by Coach–Educators as part of their coaching role
- **Video feedback** (Charlie) serves as a form of engagement and accountability
- **Onboarding calls** (Toni) set initial expectations and connection
- **Churn signals** are not systematically tracked

---

## Operating System Notes

**Group Calls:**
- All group coaching calls are hosted natively on Skool (no Zoom)
- All recordings must be posted in Skool under Call Recordings within 24 hours
- Only the most valuable calls will be curated into courses over time

**1:1 Recordings:**
- Fast-track 1:1 recordings are not posted to the community to avoid noise and decision fatigue

**Accountability System:**
- We run a 7-Day Leaderboard (Top 10) and a 30-Day Leaderboard
- Rewards are structured to incentivise submissions and progress without overextending 1:1 coaching time
- Weekly video submissions are the primary accountability mechanism

---

## Next Hire to Remove Founder Bottleneck

**Community Steward** – Dedicated role to:
- Own daily community engagement and response
- Run accountability systems systematically
- Capture success stories for marketing
- Proactively identify and intervene with at-risk members

This hire would free Coach–Educators to focus on coaching delivery rather than community management.
