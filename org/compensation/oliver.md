## Course Content Creation (Bounty-Based)

Course content creation is paid via fixed bounties, not hourly.

**Process:**

1. **Plan Creation (Required)**

   - The plan must include: scope, deliverables, breakdown (modules/lessons), timeline/effort estimate, and a proposed fixed price

2. **Founder Review & Approval**
   - The plan must be discussed and approved by the founders
   - Scope and price must be agreed before execution begins

3. **Execution & Success Payout**
   - Payment is made upon successful completion of the agreed deliverables
   - No retroactive pricing
   - Partial payments only if explicitly agreed in advance as milestones

**Responsibility:** Oliver is responsible for creating the plan to present and calculating how much it should cost the business.

| Watch Time (avg) | 3× Base | 3× Watch Time Bonus | Group Calls (36×£30) | 1-1s (9×£30) | Quarterly Total |
|------------------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| < 10,000 hrs | £3,000 | £0 | £1,080 | £270 | **£4,350** |

### Course Content Bounty (Variable)

Course content creation is paid as a bounty on top of regular earnings.

**Example:** A course module project approved at £1,000 over a 2–3 month period would add:
- £333–500/month during the project period
- Paid on successful completion of agreed deliverables

This is additional to the figures above and depends on approved course projects.
