## Course Content Creation (Bounty-Based)

Course content creation is paid via fixed bounties, not hourly.

**Process:**

1. **Plan Creation (Required)**
   - Oliver must create a detailed course content plan before work begins
   - The plan must include: scope, deliverables, breakdown (modules/lessons), timeline/effort estimate, and a proposed fixed price

2. **Founder Review & Approval**
   - The plan must be discussed and approved by the founders
   - Scope and price must be agreed before execution begins

3. **Execution & Success Payout**
   - Payment is made upon successful completion of the agreed deliverables
   - No retroactive pricing
   - Partial payments only if explicitly agreed in advance as milestones

**Responsibility:** Oliver is responsible for creating the plan to present and calculating how much it should cost the business.
