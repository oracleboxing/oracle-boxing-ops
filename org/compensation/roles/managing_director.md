# Managing Director — Success-Only Compensation

> Source of truth: [Compensation System Index](../COMPENSATION_SYSTEM.md)
> Role Definition: [Managing Director Role](../../roles/managing_director.md)

**Status:** WIP / Unassigned — This compensation model is defined but the role is not currently staffed.

---

## Overview

The Managing Director role is compensated only when defined outcomes are achieved. This model is designed to be board-defensible and attribution-safe.

**Base:** No salary uplift for this role

---

## Two-Layer Model

The Managing Director compensation has two distinct layers:

| Layer | Name | Purpose | Mechanism |
|-------|------|---------|-----------|
| **1 (Primary)** | Constraint Removal Bounties | Pay for directly attributable outcomes | Per-bounty payout when constraint is removed |
| **2 (Secondary)** | Run-Rate Milestone Bonuses | Reward sustained system-level results | One-time bonus when revenue threshold is held |

> Constraint bounties pay for directly attributable outcomes; run-rate milestones reward sustained system-level results without claiming credit for every pound of revenue.

## Layer 1: Constraint Removal Bounties (Primary)

This is the primary pay mechanism for the Managing Director role.

**Structure:**
- Each quarter includes 1–3 pre-approved bounties
- Each bounty has an agreed payout amount
- If constraint is removed per the spec → payout is earned
- If constraint is not removed → £0 for that bounty

**Example Ranges** (illustrative, not commitments):
- Typical bounty: £1,000–£2,500 depending on leverage and difficulty
- Quarterly total target: £2,000–£6,000 (only if successful)

Exact amounts are defined per bounty in the pre-agreement process.

## Layer 2: Run-Rate Milestone Bonuses (Secondary)

These bonuses reward sustained scale. They do not require claiming credit for all revenue—they acknowledge that system improvements contributed to reaching a new operating level.

**Milestone Structure:**

| Run Rate Threshold | One-Time Bonus |
|-------------------|----------------|
| £25,000/month | £2,000 |
| £35,000/month | £3,000 |
| £50,000/month | £5,000 |

**Definition: Monthly Run Rate**
> Monthly run rate is defined as the average monthly gross revenue across the most recent 3 full calendar months.

**Guardrails:**
- One-time per milestone (cannot be earned twice)
- Paid after the third month closes (when calculation is final)
- No clawback if revenue later falls below the threshold
- Milestones must be reached in order (cannot skip)

---

## Quarterly Pre-Agreement Process

At the start of each quarter, the role holder proposes 1–3 constraints to the board. The board reviews and approves each bounty before work begins.

**No bounty is payable unless pre-approved. No retroactive bounties.**

For each proposed constraint, a written **Bounty Spec** must contain:

| # | Element | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Constraint Statement** | One sentence describing the bottleneck |
| 2 | **Evidence & Impact** | Data showing this limits growth |
| 3 | **Baseline (Current State)** | Clear description of what is true today |
| 4 | **Removal Definition (Success Condition)** | Binary/verifiable condition including sustainability window |
| 5 | **Owner & Dependencies** | Who must do what; explicit dependencies |
| 6 | **System Change Required** | What will materially change |
| 7 | **Verification Plan** | How the board will verify success |
| 8 | **Payout Amount** | The bounty value in pounds |
| 9 | **Non-goals / Exclusions** | What does not count as success |
| 10 | **Approval Sign-off** | "Approved by [parties] on YYYY-MM-DD" |

---

## Fairness & Dispute Prevention

1. **Pre-agree definitions** — All success conditions must be defined before work begins
2. **Binary success** — Payout is only earned if the pre-agreed success condition is met
3. **External factors** — If external factors dominate the result, the board can revise future bounties
4. **Documentation requirement** — If it's not written down, it doesn't exist
5. **No retroactive bounties** — Cannot claim payment for past work not covered by a pre-approved spec
6. **Quarterly review** — Both founders review the model quarterly and can adjust future bounties by mutual agreement
