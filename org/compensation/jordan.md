## Growth Operator Tiered Commission (per Campaign)

**Campaign Net Profit Definition:**
> **Campaign Net Profit = Revenue − Advertising spend − Payment fees − Refunds**

Notes:
- Do **not** subtract coaching fulfilment costs (treated as fixed costs)
- Commission is calculated on **cash collected** (net of refunds) for the campaign

**Tiered Commission Structure:**

| Campaign Net Profit Band | Commission Rate |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| First £5,000 | 10% |
| £5,001 – £10,000 | 15% |
| Above £10,000 | 20% |

**Hard Cap:** Maximum commission per campaign: **£2,250**

**Worked Example:**
- Campaign Net Profit: £15,000
- Commission: (£5,000 × 10%) + (£5,000 × 15%) + (£5,000 × 20%) = £500 + £750 + £1,000 = **£2,250**

> Commission is calculated per campaign according to the tiered structure above and is capped at **£2,250 per campaign**. Commission structure is reviewed quarterly as campaign scale and business capacity evolve.
