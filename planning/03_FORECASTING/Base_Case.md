# Base Case Forecast — USD

## Purpose

The Base Case defines how Oracle Boxing clears **~$19,000/month** in revenue without relying on launches or heroics.

This scenario assumes:

- Systems function as designed
- No exceptional performance
- Campaigns are optional, not required

## Core Assumptions (Locked)

- Default intake path: **Hybrid — 6-Week Challenge → Community Education**
- Focus on:
  - Increasing upfront AOV
  - Improving upsell conversion into time-based commitments
- Cash is collected upfront
- Founder workload capped at ~50 hrs/week

## Current Baseline (Observed Reality)

Approximate recurring revenue today:

| Segment | Calculation | Monthly |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 41 members × $97 | Core community | $3,977 |
| 9 members × $70 | Legacy/other | $630 |
| **Total** | | **~$4,600** |

**Notes:**
- Additional members are trialling, free, or improperly attributed
- Hygiene fixes expected to materially improve this baseline

## Target Base Case Structure

### Education Platform (Recurring)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Active paying members | ~200 |
| Average effective monthly value | ~$90 |
| Target recurring revenue | ~$18,000/month |

This forms the **stability floor**.

## How the Base Case Is Achieved

Not through new traffic, but through:

- Improved Challenge → Membership conversion
- Defaulting to 6- and 12-month commitments
- Fixing renewal and billing leaks
- Removing non-paying / ghost accounts

## Retention Reality

- Average retention ≈ 4 months
- 6-month packages most popular
- Stripe-reported churn ≈ 12.5% (requires deeper audit)

TODO: Confirm true churn via Stripe Sigma / SQL

## Failure Conditions

The Base Case is considered broken if:

- Recurring revenue < $19k/month
- Upsells are not tracked or executed
- Founder intervention is required to maintain baseline
