# Base Case Forecast — 2026

## Purpose

The Base Case represents the scenario where:

- No heroics are required
- Systems function as designed
- Campaigns are optional, not required

This is the "steady state" where the business sustains itself without emergency interventions.

## Core Assumptions

- Default intake offer: **Hybrid — 6-Week Challenge → Fight Camp**
- Focus on:
  - Increasing upfront AOV
  - Optimising upsell conversion
- Baseline revenue must clear **£15k/month**
- Systems handle renewals, upsells, and onboarding without manual intervention

## Revenue Structure

### Base (Platform / Community)

Recurring revenue from platform access and community membership.

TODO: Base monthly subscribers and pricing

### Ascension (Upsells, Longer Commitments)

Revenue from upsells post-challenge and extended program commitments.

TODO: Upsell conversion assumptions

### Campaign Acceleration (Fight Camps)

Additional revenue from Fight Camp cohorts — accelerates growth but not required for baseline.

TODO: Average LTV per participant

| Revenue Layer | Monthly Est. | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Base | TODO | Platform/community recurring |
| Ascension | TODO | Upsells and longer commitments |
| Campaign | TODO | Fight Camp acceleration |
| **Total** | TODO | |

## Cash Timing

- All cash collected **upfront**
- Profit realised through upsells **post-delivery**
- No payment plans creating collection lag

## Failure Conditions

The Base Case is failing if:

- Baseline revenue < £15k/month
- Upsells leaking or not tracked
- Founder required to intervene constantly
- Systems breaking and requiring emergency fixes
