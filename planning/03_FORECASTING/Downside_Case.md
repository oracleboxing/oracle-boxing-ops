# Downside Case Forecast — 2026

## Purpose

The Downside Case represents what happens when:

- Conversion rates underperform
- Systems have gaps or failures
- External factors slow acquisition

This is not catastrophe — it's realistic underperformance.

## Core Assumptions

- Lower conversion rates than Base Case
- Missed upsell windows (timing, tracking failures)
- Slower acquisition from campaigns
- Higher churn than expected

## Revenue Structure

| Revenue Layer | Monthly Est. | vs Base Case |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Base | TODO | TODO |
| Ascension | TODO | TODO |
| Campaign | TODO | TODO |
| **Total** | TODO | TODO |

## Downside Drivers

- Challenge → Fight Camp conversion below target
- Upsell cash not captured (system leaks)
- Campaign ROAS lower than 2025 benchmarks
- Higher-than-expected churn

## Cash Timing

- Cash still collected upfront
- But less of it, and upsell collection may be missed entirely

## Warning Indicators

Tracking toward Downside if:

- Baseline revenue < £15k/month
- Upsell tracking shows leaks or gaps
- Founder constantly intervening to fix issues
- Campaign performance significantly below 2025

## Mitigation

TODO: Cost controls — what can be reduced if revenue underperforms?

TODO: Cycle pacing adjustments — can we slow cadence to reduce burn?

## Contingency Triggers

If Downside materialises:

- Review payroll structure (largest cost lever)
- Pause non-essential spend
- Focus on fixing system leaks before next cycle
