# 2025 Performance Review

## High-Level Summary

2025 was a year of campaign-driven growth experimentation. The business ran multiple acquisition campaigns throughout the year, with financial results closely tied to campaign timing rather than steady-state operations.

The year ended with a small net loss (-£3,522.38 YTD as of Dec 19), but the final quarter showed signs of improvement with an average net profit of £1,102.60 over the last three months.

See: [2025 Financial Summary](2025_Financial_Summary.md) for detailed numbers.

## Monthly Performance in Context (Campaign-Led)

The monthly profit pattern tells a campaign story:

- **March (~£4.4k profit):** Fight Camp II launched — the first fight camp of the year
- **April:** Price increase campaign rolled out
- **July (~£3.26k profit):** Fight Camp III — second fight camp campaign
- **September:** 6-Week Challenge launched (acquisition/front-end)
- **October (~£9.14k profit):** Upsell cash collected from September's challenge
- **November (-£1.99k loss):** Black Friday Challenge launched (acquisition cost incurred)
- **December:** Upsell cash collection expected (in progress)

See: [2025 Campaigns](2025_Campaigns.md) for full timeline.

## Structural Observations

### Campaign → Delay → Collect Rhythm

There's a predictable lag between launching a campaign (acquisition cost) and collecting the upsell revenue. This creates a "spend now, collect later" cash flow pattern that makes individual months misleading.

TODO: Quantify the typical lag (appears to be ~1 month based on Sep→Oct pattern)

### Payroll as the Largest Cost Lever

Payroll represents approximately 49% of total expenses. This is the single biggest line item and the most significant lever for profitability.

TODO: Break down payroll by role/function
TODO: Identify which payroll costs are fixed vs. variable with revenue

### Revenue Concentration

TODO: How much revenue came from campaigns vs. steady-state memberships?
TODO: What's the retention rate on challenge participants?

## Core 2025 Lesson

TODO: Summarise the single most important lesson from 2025

Candidates to consider:
- Campaign timing matters more than campaign frequency
- The upsell conversion rate determines whether challenges are profitable
- Payroll needs to flex with revenue, not stay fixed
- Something else entirely
