# 2025 Performance Review

## High-Level Summary

- 2025 was proof of demand, not stability
- Profitability was episodic and campaign-led
- Loss months were caused by unintentional overhead drift
- Cash collection was always upfront

The year ended with a small net loss (-£3,522.38 YTD as of Dec 19), but the final quarter showed signs of improvement with an average net profit of £1,102.60 over the last three months.

See: [2025 Financial Summary](2025_Financial_Summary.md) for detailed numbers.

## Monthly Performance in Context (Campaign-Led)

The monthly profit pattern tells a campaign story:

- **March (~£4.4k profit):** Fight Camp II launched — the first fight camp of the year
- **April:** Price increase campaign rolled out
- **July (~£3.26k profit):** Fight Camp III — second fight camp campaign
- **September:** 6-Week Challenge launched (acquisition/front-end)
- **October (~£9.14k profit):** Upsell cash collected from September's challenge
- **November (-£1.99k loss):** Black Friday Challenge launched (acquisition cost incurred)
- **December:** Upsell cash collection expected (in progress)

See: [2025 Campaigns](2025_Campaigns.md) for full timeline.

## Offer-Level Reality (2025)

### Primary Profit Drivers

- **6-Week Challenge** — Front-end acquisition with upsell conversion
- **Fight Camps II & III** — Event-based cohorts with strong margins

### Secondary / Amplifier

- **Upsells** — Back-end revenue dependent on challenge performance
- **1-on-1 coaching** — High margin, capacity-bound

### Non-Core / Incremental

- Courses & bundles
- Merch

## Operational Observations

### Campaign → Delay → Collect Rhythm

There's a predictable lag between launching a campaign (acquisition cost) and collecting the upsell revenue. This creates a "spend now, collect later" cash flow pattern that makes individual months misleading.

### Payroll as the Primary Cost Lever

Payroll represents approximately 49% of total expenses. This is the single biggest line item and the most significant lever for profitability.

### High-Performing Acquisition with Weak Baseline Months

Campaigns drive strong spikes, but baseline months without campaigns often run at a loss due to fixed overhead.
