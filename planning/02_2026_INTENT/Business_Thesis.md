# Oracle Boxing — 2026 Business Thesis

## What Business We Are In

Oracle Boxing in 2026 is a **systems-based boxing education platform**.

The primary output is not content, launches, or hype, but **codified systems** that reliably develop boxers, coaches, and educators through structured progression.

## What We Are NOT

Oracle Boxing is no longer allowed to be:

- A business that struggles to retain profit
- A business that leaks customers or upsell cash
- A content treadmill with no leverage or compounding effect

**Any activity that does not build durable systems is considered a liability.**

## Primary Optimisation Axis (2026)

**Skill and system building** (long-term compounding) is the primary optimisation axis.

This applies to:

- **Jordan** → becoming a better entrepreneur
- **Toni** → becoming a better coach
- **Oliver** → becoming a better boxer and educator

Revenue exists to fund compounding capability.

## Founder Constraints

- Target workload: **~50 hours/week**
- The business must stop:
  - Breaking technically
  - Creating staff fires
  - Requiring emergency revenue or profit fixes

**Systems must function without heroics.**

## Financial Intent

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Baseline stability floor | £15,000/month revenue |
| Growth target | £25,000/month run rate by December 2026 |

- Baseline must **not depend on campaigns**
- Growth achieved through improved AOV, LTV, retention, and upsell execution
- **Campaigns accelerate growth — they do not sustain the business**

## Campaign Philosophy

Campaigns exist to **feed and strengthen the platform**, not to save the business month to month.
