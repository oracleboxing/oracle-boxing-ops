# Q1 2026 Roadmap (January – March)

## Primary Objective

Build baseline stability and run first Hybrid Growth Cycle.

## Growth Cycle Focus

**Hybrid Challenge → Fight Camp**

The default intake model: 6-Week Challenge as the front-end, with Fight Camp as the natural progression for committed participants.

## Key Systems to Build or Fix

- [ ] **Onboarding** — Reliable new member experience that doesn't require manual intervention
- [ ] **Upsell tracking** — Clear visibility into who is ready for ascension and when
- [ ] **Subscription automation** — Renewals, failed payment recovery, and churn prevention working automatically

## Revenue Intent

Establish path to **£15k/month baseline**.

This quarter is about proving the systems work, not maximising revenue.

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| System leaks (renewals, upsells) | Medium | High | Audit and fix before first cycle |
| Over-complexity in build | Medium | Medium | Keep scope minimal |
| Founder overload | Medium | High | Protect ~50 hr/week boundary |

## Q1 Success Criteria

By March 31, Q1 is successful if:

- First Hybrid Growth Cycle completed
- Onboarding, upsell tracking, and subscription systems functional
- Baseline revenue trajectory toward £15k/month
- No major system fires requiring emergency fixes
